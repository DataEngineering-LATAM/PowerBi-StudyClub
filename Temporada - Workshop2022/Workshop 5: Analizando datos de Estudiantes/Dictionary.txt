Basic data like:

ID: Student ID
class: categorical, initially students were divided into 2 classes, yet teachers suspect that of different classes students may performance significant differently.
gender: student gender (female / male)
race: categorical and censored
GPA: real numbers, float
Some teachers assume that scores of math curriculums can represent one's likelihood perfectly:

Algebra: real numbers, Advanced Algebra
……
Some assume that background of students can affect their choices and likelihood significantly, which are all censored as:
from1: students' home locations
from2: a probably bad indicator for preference on mathematics
from 3: how did students apply for this university (undergraduate)
from4: a probably bad indicator for family background. 0 with more wealth, 4 with more poverty
The final indicator y:

0, one fails to apply for the graduate school, who may apply again or search jobs in the future
